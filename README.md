# README

This repository contains notes on programming and the use of various bits of
software. They are beginner and day-to-day guides, not thorough explorations of
all possibilities.

## Rendering

The documentation is written in reStructuredText, for use with [Sphinx]. The
documentation can be rendered with:

    sphinx-build -b html src dst

The start page will then be called `dst/index.html`.

C
=

C is considered a low-level programming language, in that it is similar to the
machine code executed by computers directly [#low-level]_. It does not offer as
many useful features as other languages, but it can be very fast and is
available on almost all platforms. Many higher level programming languages are
capable of interfacing with C code in some way, so it serves as a common
language for communicating between them.

Compiling
+++++++++

C does not offer a REPL (read-eval-print loop) like many other languages (e.g.
Python). This means that a whole program must be compiled and then run from the
:ref:`command-line <command-line-guide>`. For example, suppose we have the
following C program::

  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(int argc, char ** argv) {
    for (unsigned int i = 0; i < argc; i++){
      printf("%s ", argv[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
  }

Most Linux distributions have ``cc`` available as a C compiler. OSX uses the
``clang`` comand instead. The following command compiles the file ``echo.c``
(containing the program above), and saves the result in a file called
``echo``::

  > cc -o echo echo.c

Now, we can run the resulting program::

  > ./echo Hello, world!
  Hello, world!

Unspecified Behaviour
---------------------

In some cases, the result of an operation is not specified by the standard. In
some cases, the result is said to be `implementation-defined`. This means the
operation is correct and will not disrupt the program, but the exact result may
vary between different operating systems and compilers.

.. warning:: In other cases, the behaviour of a C program is `undefined` by the
   language standard. This may cause surprising and unexpected program
   behaviour, and must be avoided.

Types
+++++

The data-types in C are very similar to what is used by a computer internally to
represent data, so some discussion of these is needed.

Integers
--------

Integers are the simplest data type, representing whole numbers.

Sizes
~~~~~

Integers come in various sizes, usually multiples of 8 bits. The values that can
be represented by an integer depend on its size. The number of values that can
be represented is :math:`2^{\mathrm{bits}}`. The traditional C types to
represent integers (``char``, ``short``, ``int`` and ``long``) have varying
sizes depending on the platform, so the modern versions are preferred. To use
them, you need to `include <Includes_>`_ the ``stdint.h`` header.

The basic integer types look like ``int8_t``, where ``8`` should be replaced
with the desired size in bits. There also exist ``int_fast8_t`` and
``int_least8_t``, which are the fastest and smallest types of at least 8 bits in
size respectively (and similarly for other sizes). `Unsigned <Signedness_>`_
types begin with ``uint`` instead of ``int``.

Signedness
~~~~~~~~~~

Integers may be signed, in which case they can represent negative numbers, or
unsigned, in which case they can only represent positive numbers. In the case of
signed integers, their available range is split in half; an 8-bit unsigned
integer can represent the numbers 0 to 255 (inclusive), while an 8-bit signed
integer can represent the numbers -128 to 127.

.. attention:: The result of assigning a value that a signed integer type cannot
   represent is implementation-defined.

Unsigned integers wrap when they overflow (e.g. for an 8-bit variable, ``255 + 1
== 0``).

.. warning:: Overflow of signed integers is undefined.

Enums
-----

Enumerations (or `enums`) are similar to integer types in that they represent
discrete values. However, the values they represent are chosen by the user. For
example, suppose we want to represent a list of available colors::

  enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
  };

This defines an enum named ``enum Color``, with the values ``Red``, ``Green``
and ``Blue``. By default, enums are assigned sequential values beginning with
``0``, but they may also be explicitly assigned values::

  enum Color {
    Red = 2,
    Green,
    Blue = 4,
    Rouge = Red,
  };

If any enum member is not assigned a value, its value is the value of the member
above plus one. Any previously defined member can also be used as a value.

Floats
------

Floating point numbers are a way to represent numbers with a fixed number of
significant figures over a large range. They consist of a sign bit, a
significand and an exponent. The final value is given by:

.. math::

   (-1)^{\mathrm{sign}} \times {\mathrm{significand}}
   \times 2^{\mathrm{exponent}}

They are commonly available in 32-bit (24-bit significand and 8-bit exponent)
and 64-bit (53-bit significand and 11-bit exponent) sizes, known as ``float``
and ``double`` respectively.

Pointers
--------

Pointers are references to locations in computer memory. They are represented by
a ``*`` after the type stored in the location they are pointing to (e.g.
``uint8_t*`` is a pointer to a ``uint8_t``). A special type ``void*`` also
exists, which is a pointer to general-purpose memory of no specific type. To get
a pointer to a value, add a ``&`` in front of the value::

  int x = 4;
  int* x_ptr = &x;

Pointers are often used to represent `arrays <Arrays_>`_ by taking a pointer to
the first element. As arrays are stored contiguously in memory, the second
element can be accessed by simply incrementing the pointer, and so on for
further elements.

.. warning:: Pointers do not store any information about the length of an array,
   and reading or writing to memory past the end of an array is undefined
   behaviour.

Compound Types
--------------

These base types can be assembled into compound types.

Arrays
~~~~~~

Arrays are the simplest kind of compound type, and simply consist of a type
repeated several times in memory. For example, an array of 3 ``float`` values
may be used to describe a point::

  float point[3];

The three values are stored consecutively in memory, which means that a pointer
to the second element in the array (``&point[1]``) is one greater than a pointer
to the first element in the array (``&point[0]``).

Strings
~~~~~~~

In many cases, strings (i.e. text) are represented by an array of ``char`` (or
a pointer to the first element). The end of the string is marked by the special
character ``NULL``. This gives flexibility in that the length of the string can
vary.

.. warning:: Ensure the trailing ``NULL`` is present to avoid undefined
   behaviour by accidentally accessing values beyond the end of the string.

Structs
~~~~~~~

Structures (or `structs`) are types containing fields, each containing another
type. For example, information about a train might be represented by::

  struct Train {
    uint16_t num_carriages;
    float speed;
    char* model;
  };

In this case, the struct named ``struct Train`` has three members,
``num_carriages`` of type ``uint16_t``, ``speed`` of type ``float`` and the
string ``model``.

Unions
~~~~~~

A union looks similar to the struct, but only one of its members may be defined
at a time. For example, if a user is represented by a unique ID or his name,
this could be defined as a union::

  union User {
    uint32_t id;
    char * name;
  }

Note that if a different member is used to read than to store, the resulting
value may not contain valid information. For example::

  union User u = {.name = "Some name"};
  uint32_t id = u.id;

In this case, ``id`` contains the address of ``"Some name"``, interpreted as an
integer. This is probably not a valid user id.

Program Structure
+++++++++++++++++

Constructs which will show up frequently below are expressions, statements, and
blocks.

Expressions
-----------

Expressions are fragments of code that evaluate to a value. They may be
`variables <Variables_>`_ (``x``), `function <Functions_>`_ evaluations
(``add(x, y)``), `operator <Operators_>`_ evaluations (``x + 2``) or `literals
<Literals_>`_ (``4``). Assignment of a value to a variable is also an
expression, and returns the value being assigned (``x = 2`` evaluates to ``2``).

The comma (``,``) can be used to evaluate multiple expressions where only one is
expected. All expressions will be evaluated, but only the last one will be
returned. For example, ``x = (puts("foo"), 2, 3)`` will assign ``3`` to ``x``.
The fact that all expressions are evaluated is important because any
side-effects will be observed, in this case ``foo`` will be printed.

Statements
----------

Statements in contrast, do not return values. Every statement is terminated by a
semi-colon ``;``.

Blocks
------

Blocks are groups of statements, surrounded by curly braces ``{}``.

Literals
++++++++

A literal is a value defined in the source code of the program.

Numbers
-------

Several kind of numbers are supported.

Integers
~~~~~~~~

Integers (whole numbers) can be written in decimal form (``23``). The integer
will be sized such that the number can be represented. The suffix ``u`` can be
added to specify that the number is `unsigned`. ``l`` or ``ll`` can be added to
specify the number should be at least the size of a ``long`` or ``long long``
integer respectively.

Floats
~~~~~~

Floats, or floating precision numbers are decimals with a specific number of
significant figures (``1.4``). Values are double-precision floats, unless the
specifier ``f`` is appended to specify single-precision.

Characters
~~~~~~~~~~

Characters are single letters enclosed in single quotation marks (``'a'``).

.. note:: some complex characters, e.g. ``Ã¼``, are actually composed of a
   character and a modifier drawn in one space, so do not count as C characters.

Strings
~~~~~~~

Variables
+++++++++

A variable is declared by stating its type, followed by its name::

  int i;

This may optionally be followed by an assignment::

  int k = 3;
  int j = k;

If a value is not specified, expressions reading from the value may evaluate to
any value.

Memory
------

C programs assume that the computer has a linear, continuous range of memory
available. This is split into three sections - constant, stack and heap memory.

Printing
--------

Due to the lack of a REPL, it is very useful to be able to print the contents of
a variable in C. This is done with the ``printf`` `function <Functions_>`_. The
first argument to this function is the `format string`, specially formatted text
that will define how the variables are printed. Every instance of ``%``,
followed by a letter, will be replaced by the value of a variable from the
remaining arguments. The letter used depends on the type of the variable.

=================== ==========================================================
Format code         Variable type
=================== ==========================================================
``d``, ``i``        Signed integer, formatted as decimal
``u``, ``o``, ``x`` Unsigned signed integer, formatted as decimal, octal or
                    hexadecimal
``c``               single character
``s``               null-terminated string
``p``               pointer
``f``               floating-point value in normal notation
``e``               floating-point value in scientific notation
``g``               floating-point value in normal or scientific notation, as
                    appropriate for its magnitude
=================== ==========================================================

For example, the variables below::

  char s[] = "foobar";
  unsigned int i = 3;
  int j = 4;
  float k = 5.0;

Could be used as follows in a ``printf`` call::

  printf("printed: %s %d %u %f '%c' %p\n", s, i, j, k, s[2], &j);

This would output::

  printed: foobar 3 4 5.0 'o' 0x7ffe4517656c

Note that arbitrary characters can be mixed in with the format codes. Also, to
print a newline, the ``\n`` `escape` is used. Other characters that may be
escaped are tabs (``\t``), quotes (``\"``) and backslashes (``\\``). To print a
percent sign, double it (``%%``).

Additionally, integer format codes may be preceeded by a length specifier, that
specifies the size of the argument (if omitted, it is assumed to be the size of
an ``int``).

=========== =============
Length code Size
=========== =============
``hh``      ``char``
``h``       ``short``
``l``       ``long``
``ll``      ``long long``
``z``       ``size_t``
``t``       ``ptrdiff_t``
=========== =============

Floating point values allow the ``L`` length code for ``long double`` values.

Functions
+++++++++

From a programmer's perspective, executing a C program starts with the ``main``
function. This is known as the `entry point` to the program.

.. [#low-level] C does hide many details of computer hardware, such as the
   multiple levels of caching of memory. It is still lower level than most other
   languages.

.. [#nostd] Technically, it is the ``_start`` function. However, most C programs
   use the standard library, which implements that function for you.

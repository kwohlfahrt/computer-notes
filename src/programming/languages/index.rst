Summaries
+++++++++

This section is a quick overview of various programming languages for which I
have not yet written any in-depth guides.

C
-

One of the oldest programming languages still in use is `C`. It very widespread,
and included in almost all Linux distributions and macOS. Many languages have a
small core implemented in `C`, and it is often used as a common interface
between toolkits. However, it lacks some of the useful features of more modern
languages. It is a compiled, imperative, statically typed programming language.

Python
------

`Python <CPython_>`_ is an interpreted, dynamically typed programming language.
It is largely imperative, but also has some functional programming features.
Alternative implementations which are compiled on-the-fly for performance, such
as `PyPy`_, exist too.

Haskell
-------

`Haskell <haskell_>`_ is a compiled, statically typed, functional programming
language. The web-site includes a simple haskell interpreter.

Rust
----

`Rust <rust_>`_ is a compiled, statically typed programming language. It is
largely imperative, but has good support for functional programming styles.

Scheme
------

Scheme is a dynamically typed, interpreted programming language. It is a
functional programming language known for its minimalism.

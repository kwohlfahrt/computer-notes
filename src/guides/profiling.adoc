= Profiling

Profiling refers to the process of recording statistics about the execution of a
process, with the aim of guiding optimization.

== Perf

`perf` is a sampling profiler for Linux. It is invoked as follows:

  perf record -F 99 --call-graph=fp -- <executable>

If debug info is output in DWARF format, use `--call-graph=dwarf` instead.

=== Flame Graphs

Flame graphs are a useful visualization, and can be generated from `perf` traces
as follows ( after `perf record`):

  perf script | stackcollapse-perf.pl | flamgegraph.pl > <output>
